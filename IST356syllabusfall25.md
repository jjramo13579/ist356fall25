## Course Description
Approaches for building pipelines in data analytics using the Python programming language; data cleaning, extraction, wrangling, APIâ€™s, web scraping. Building data products. Programming experience required.

### Additional Course Description

This course is a tour of programming techniques for building data pipelines for analytics. It will not just emphasize exploratory approaches, but also techniques to build extract transform load pipelines to run code in production. 
Throughout the course we will learn how to source data from a variety of sources (files, data streams, APIs, web scraping, etc.) and ultimately transform data as to prepare it for dashboards or machine learning. You will also learn 
some simple data visualization but that is not the primary emphasis of the course. 

### Prerequisites

 This courses uses the Python programming language. Proficiency in any programming language is the only pre-requisite. Students should have a clear understanding of these concepts: 

 - Input, output, variables and data types
 - Control flow statements (if, for, while)
 - Functions (function definition, calling, parameters, return values)
 - Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
 - Using code in other libraries 

### Audience: IST256 or IST356?

This course is intended as a follow up course to IST256. It is also appropriate for students with prior experience with programming who have an interest in data analytics.

- IST256 is for students with little to no programming experience. The course content is 75% python fundamentals and 25% python for data analytics. 
- IST356 is for students with prior programming experience. The course content is 25% python fundamentals and 75% python for data analytics. 

### Credits

3 credits

### Course Fees

None

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Explain techniques for sourcing or transforming data, and be able to justify the choice of technique
2. Solve data-oriented problems using programming techniques
3. Evaluate different code modules and application programming interfaces for suitability
4. Apply data transformational programming techniques to build a larger data pipelines
5. Create production quality data pipelines from exploratory code


## Textbooks And Supplies

### Textbooks

All required readings are available freely online, and in many cases, the online sources are the most up-to-date references to the relevant course material. See reading list section for additional details. 

#### Main Text

- Python Programming for Data Science, by T. Beuzen (2021)
[https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-programming-for-data-science/](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-programming-for-data-science/)


### Bring Your Own Device

You are expected to bring your fully powered computer to each class session. This class is very hands-on, and you will be programming in class over the semester. 

#### Software to install

This course requires you to install software on your computer. You will need to ensure that you have space available. The intro section of this course provides detailed instructions.

- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code editor
- Git Source Code Managment

#### Accounts

- We will use Github for assignment submission. 

## Course Requirements and Expectations

### Attendance and Participation

You are expected to attend and participate in every class session. If you must miss class, you will be responsible for making up the work and catching up on what was missed. I recommend reaching out to me to review content you missed. Also consider reaching out to a classmate to share notes from class.

### Assignments

The assignments are programming / problem solving activities that you will complete outside of class. The assignment due dates are posted on the course schedule. Consider these assignments formative assessments - practice so you can get better at computational thinking, problem solving and writing code. It is important to reflect upon your work and take an honest assessment of your abilities as you complete each assignment. 

Each Monday we will review the homework assignment. Students will be asked to contribute to the discussion.

Factors affecting your grade:

- Is the code working and correct?
- Were the instructions followed? (e.g. commit after each function is written)
- Good reflection: specific, uses terminology, actionable
- Handed in on time, so your prof only needs to review submissions 1 time.

### Exams

Exams are summative assessments. They are designed to test your knowledge of the material.  The exams will be issued in class on the dates posted on the course schedule. Exams are closed-book but you may bring one sided 8.5x11 sheet of paper with your notes on it. Exam length are 60 minutes. They will be a  mix of multiple choice and short answer and code tracing.

### Project

The project is your opportunity to demonstrate what you have learned in an experiential fashion. In your final project you will be expected to create a data pipeline of your choosing. 

- The pipeline should incorporate techniques we learned in the course and the more techniques you incorporate correctly the higher your grade.
- It is expected that you will be able to explain your choices, and they will be appropriate for the problem.
- The pipeline should be first written exploratory, and then refactored into a production quality pipeline. Both pipelines should be submitted.
- There should be a simple data visualization or dashboard from the pipeline output as to demonstrate its usefulness.

## Other Policies

### Use of AI in this Course

Based on the assignments in this course and our specified learning outcomes, the full use of artificial intelligence as a tool, with disclosure and citation, is permitted in this course. Students do not need to ask permission to use these tools before starting an assignment or exam, but they must explicitly and fully indicate which tools were used and describe how they were used.
